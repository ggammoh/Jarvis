 While creating this program I ran into many errors using the playaudio library.
 Ocassionally I would run into error 263 which I believe is when it tries to call a file that doesnt exist.
 It seems that downgrading to version 1.2.2 of playsound fixes this error for the most part.

Known errors include:
Error 263: I belive this is when the program tries to call a file that does not exist. This has hopefully been solved by downgrading the playsound library to version 1.2.2
